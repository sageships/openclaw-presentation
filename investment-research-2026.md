# 🔥 Sector Deep Dive: IT

---

# Why IT Crashed

1. **DeepSeek AI** — Chinese model spooked markets
2. **Global tech selloff** — IGV ETF down 5%
3. **Fear of disruption** — "Will AI replace services?"

**Reality Check (JPMorgan):**
> "Markets have veered from rational concern to outright panic"

Enterprise software demand remains resilient.

---

# IT Opportunities

**Large Caps (if you want stability):**
- TCS, Infosys, Wipro — all down significantly

**Mid Caps (higher risk/reward):**
- Mastek (UK govt exposure)
- Newgen (product company)
- Sonata (high ROE)

**Timing:** Wait for VIX to cool, accumulate in tranches

# 📈 Investment Strategy

# Approach for 2026

1. **SIP into quality** — Don't time the bottom
2. **Diversify** — Mix of sectors
